<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>Step 1
    Preheat oven to 350°. Line three 9” cake
    pans with parchment and grease with
    cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk
    together flour, cocoa powder, salt,
    baking soda, and baking powder. 
    Step 2
    In another large bowl, whisk together
    vegetable oil, sugars, and eggs and
    whisk until incorporated, then add
    melted chocolate and vanilla and whisk
    until incorporated. Add chocolate
    mixture, buttermilk, and coffee to dry
    ingredients and mix just until combined.
    Step 3
    Divide batter evenly between prepared
    cake pans and bake until a toothpick
    inserted in the middle comes out clean,
    about 20 minutes. Let cakes cool 10
    minutes, then invert onto a wire baking
    rack and cool completely. 
    Step 4
    Meanwhile, make filling: Spread
    coconut and pecans onto 2 separate
    baking sheets. Toast in a 350° oven until
    coconut is golden and pecans are
    darkened and smell nutty, stirring
    halfway through. Coconut will take 10
    to 12 minutes and pecans will need 15
    to 18 minutes. Combine into a large bowl. 
    Step 5
    In a medium saucepan over medium
    heat, combine evaporated milk, egg
    yolks, sugar, and salt. Whisk until
    thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Sauce
    should be able to coat the back of a
    wooden spoon and not run when a
    finger is swiped through it. Remove from
    heat and stir in butter and vanilla until
    incorporated. Pour over pecans and
    coconut and stir to coat. Let cool
    completely. Sauce will continue to thicken as it cools. 
    Step 6
    Make ganache: Place chocolate chips
    into a heat safe bowl. In a small
    saucepan over medium heat, warm
    heavy cream until bubbles form around
    the edges. Pour heavy cream over
    chocolate chips and let sit 1 minute,
    then whisk until smooth. Let cool until
    ganache is thick enough to spread, at least 30 minutes. 
    Step 7
    Assemble cake: Place one layer of cake
    onto a cake stand or serving platter.
    Spread ⅓ of ganache on top and then
    spread ⅓ of coconut filling on top. Top
    with a second layer of cake and repeat
    with remaining ganache, coconut filling, and cake.
