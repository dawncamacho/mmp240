                <p>"Mayans M.C." follows the life of Ezekiel "EZ" Reyes, 
                    a member of the Mayans M.C. charter on the
                     California/Mexico border.
                     Once a golden boy with the
                     American dream within his grasp,
                     EZ and his brother, Angel, 
                    are closer than ever after uncovering
                     the truth behind their mother's murder.
                     Faced with carving out a new identity
                     for himself in his small town,
                     EZ's need for vengeance drives him 
                    toward a life he never intended.
                     Meanwhile, their father, Felipe, struggles
                     to reconcile the choices he and his sons have made.</p>
